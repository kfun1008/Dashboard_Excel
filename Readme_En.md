# 📊 LiveStock Feed Dashboard (Small Business case in Colombia)

This project is based on a real case from a small agricultural company **(PYME)** in Colombia. The company decided to expand its businees into the **livestock feed** market, beginning with the production and sale of **hay** in the region.


# 🧩 The Challenge

Due to manually control inventory tracking and lack of real-time data the business faced:

- **High waste and internal consumption**
- **Poor visibility of client behavior**
- **Low sale due to high waste and internal consumption**
- **No performance indicators in place**

It answers key questions such as:
- How much is produced, sold, or lost?
- Who are the most loyal clients?
- What is the real value of sales vs. production?
- How much is lost to waste or internal use?
